## 1. Proposed solution, revenue model and value proposal.

Problem Statement:

Bogota Parking App:

It's well known that in some parts of Bogota parking lots are limited, all potential users (specially students,workers and tourists), have to make long lines and wait tens of minutes for being able to park . One of the biggest problems is not knowing when a parking lot is free, if are they full or what's the approximate time in line for getting a place to park. Knowing the actual situation, if the potential users of the parking lot could get real time information about the parking lot state, statistics about it or even make a reservation, lots of problems related with it could be solved.
Proposed Solution: ParkEz

ParkEz is a Parking Space Sharing and Reservation Platform that revolutionizes urban parking by seamlessly connecting large parking facilities and individual parking space owners with users. Through our user-friendly app, ParkEz offers a dynamic marketplace that transforms parking into a hassle-free experience for everyone involved.

### Features:

* Streamlined Connectivity: ParkEz serves as a bridge between large parking facilities and individual owners, creating a unified platform for users to find parking spaces effortlessly. 
* Advanced Search: The platform provides an advanced search feature with filters, empowering users to locate their ideal parking spot based on factors such as location, price range, and availability.
* Real-time Updates: Users receive real-time updates on available parking spaces from both provider types, enabling quick identification of vacant spots.
* Effortless Booking: Booking with ParkEz is a breeze. Users can make online reservations in advance or secure parking instantly to cater to planned and spontaneous needs.
* Effective Communication: Direct messaging facilitates effective communication between users and parking space providers, ensuring individual requirements are met.
* Trust-building Reviews: A review and ratings system allows users to provide feedback on their parking experience, fostering trust and transparency in both large facilities and individual spaces.
* Secure Transactions: Easy payment integration guarantees secure transactions for both types of providers, enhancing user confidence.
* Reservation Managment: Parking space owners have access to reservation management tools that enhance the efficient handling of bookings.
* Loyalty Program: A loyalty program rewards frequent users, adding an extra layer of benefits and incentives to the ParkEz experience.

### Revenue model:

We planned to offer a multidimensional revenue model in order to get the user easily engaged with the app, the main points are:

1. #### Service Fee per Reservation:
  Charge users a nominal service fee, such as 1000 COP, for each parking space reservation they make through your platform. This fee applies every time a user successfully books a parking spot. Ensure that the fee is prominently displayed during the reservation process.

2. #### Premium Features:
  Offer premium features or subscription tiers for users who want additional benefits, such as faster booking confirmation, priority access to highly sought-after spots, or enhanced customer support. Users can pay a monthly or yearly fee for these premium services.

3. #### Loyalty Program:
  Implement a loyalty program that rewards frequent users with discounts or cashback for every successful booking they make. This encourages repeat usage and user retention.

4. #### Group Reservations Fee:
  Charge a slightly lower fee for users who make group reservations for events, meetings, or outings. This fee can be based on the number of parking spaces booked within a single reservation.

5. #### Cancellation Fees:
  Implement a small cancellation fee for users who cancel their reservations within a certain time frame, discouraging last-minute cancellations and ensuring fairness to parking space owners.

6. #### Advertising and Partnerships:
  Collaborate with local businesses or event organizers and offer premium advertising space on your platform. Charge businesses for promoting their services or events to your user base.

7. #### Data Analytics Insights:
  Offer data analytics and insights services to parking space owners, helping them optimize their pricing strategies and improve their parking spaces' appeal. Charge owners for these additional data-driven services.

8. #### Featured Listings:
  Allow parking space owners to pay a fee to have their listings featured prominently on your platform's search results. This increases the visibility of their parking spaces and can lead to more bookings.

9. #### Subscription Plans for Parking Space Owners:
  Offer subscription plans for parking space owners who want to list multiple parking spaces or require additional tools and services for managing their listings efficiently.

10. #### Transaction Fees for Owners:
  Charge parking space owners a smaller fee if they made successful reservations through your platform. This encourages owners to actively use your service and list their parkings.

## 6. Business questions

Type 1 (App's telemetry: questions that are related to crashes, bugs, performance, stability issues, device-related statistics, etc.):
* Are the parking spots loading in less than 3 seconds (on devices with Android version 8.0 or higher) or do we have to change something to achieve this? (performance)
* Exist a screen or module that makes the app crashes? Where, when and why? (crashes)
* are the credit card payments processing in les than 10 seconds? Is an api issue or an app issue? (performance)

Type 2 (Direct user experience improvement: questions that focus on improving user experience in the daily usage/interaction.):
* How many steps it takes to reserve a parking spot? Is it possible to reduce unnecessary steps? (improving user experience)
* Is it useful for the user to see the last action they did?  (improving daily usage/interaction)
* What are the nearest parking from the users' most frequented places? (improving daily usage/interaction)
* What is the average waiting time for a parking spot to be freed? (improving experience)

Type 3 (Features analysis: questions that helps the business to decide about the implementation of a new feature, or removal/update of an existing one.):
* How much time is a user willing to wait for a parking spot to be freed? (new feature - approx time to wait)
* Which spots and sections of the parking are the most/less used? (new feature - indicates that is a "preferred spot free")
* How many times per reserve is the user location matching the parking location? (update - Prehold a spot for a certain amountof time)

Type 4 (Benefits from data: questions that helps the business to understand how they can make profit or take advantage from its data with third party companies.):
* Which places are the most requested in the city? (understand where is a business necessity)
* What is the average/maximum price a user would pay for reserving a parking spot? (understand what is the optimal range of prices and if could be dinamic)

Type 5 (Questions that are meant to answer more than one topic from the other four types.):
* What users use the parking service for more than 6 hours on a day? (type 2, 4)
