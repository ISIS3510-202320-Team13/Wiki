## 1. Proposed solution, revenue model and value proposal.

Problem Statement:

Bogota Parking App:

It's well known that in some parts of Bogota parking lots are limited, all potential users (specially students,workers and tourists), have to make long lines and wait tens of minutes for being able to park . One of the biggest problems is not knowing when a parking lot is free, if are they full or what's the approximate time in line for getting a place to park. Knowing the actual situation, if the potential users of the parking lot could get real time information about the parking lot state, statistics about it or even make a reservation, lots of problems related with it could be solved.
Proposed Solution: ParkEz

## 6. Business questions

Type 1 (App's telemetry: questions that are related to crashes, bugs, performance, stability issues, device-related statistics, etc.):
* Are the parking spots loading in less than 3 seconds (on devices with Android version 8.0 or higher) or do we have to change something to achieve this? (performance)
* Exist a screen or module that makes the app crashes? Where, when and why? (crashes)
* are the credit card payments processing in les than 10 seconds? Is an api issue or an app issue? (performance)

Type 2 (Direct user experience improvement: questions that focus on improving user experience in the daily usage/interaction.):
* How many steps it takes to reserve a parking spot? Is it possible to reduce unnecessary steps? (improving user experience)
* Is it useful for the user to see the last action they did?  (improving daily usage/interaction)
* What are the nearest parking from the users' most frequented places? (improving daily usage/interaction)
* What is the average waiting time for a parking spot to be freed? (improving experience)

Type 3 (Features analysis: questions that helps the business to decide about the implementation of a new feature, or removal/update of an existing one.):
* How much time is a user willing to wait for a parking spot to be freed? (new feature - approx time to wait)
* Which spots and sections of the parking are the most/less used? (new feature - indicates that is a "preferred spot free")
* How many times per reserve is the user location matching the parking location? (update - Prehold a spot for a certain amountof time)

Type 4 (Benefits from data: questions that helps the business to understand how they can make profit or take advantage from its data with third party companies.):
* Which places are the most requested in the city? (understand where is a business necessity)
* What is the average/maximum price a user would pay for reserving a parking spot? (understand what is the optimal range of prices and if could be dinamic)

Type 5 (Questions that are meant to answer more than one topic from the other four types.):
* What users use the parking service for more than 6 hours on a day? (type 2, 4)
* how much revenue is lost from the app crashes leaving incomplete transactions? (type 1, 4)

## 8. Functional Scenarios

1. I'm Juan Fernando, a student at "Universidad de los Andes", and I want to ensure that when I arrive with my car before my 9:00 class, there is a free parking spot available. To achieve this, I would like the system to display the available parking spots near the university. This way, when I select one, I can make a reservation.
2. I'm Juan Fernando, a student at "Universidad de los Andes", and I want to find a cheap parking spot near the University. To achive this, I would like the system to display the price of parking spots near the university and sort them by price. This way, I could select a cheap one that fits my need. This is valuable to me because, as a student, I have a limited budget for my daily expenses.
3. I'm Guillermo and I'm the owner of the Tequendama parking lot. I want to register my parking lot in the ParkEz app in order to organize my parking lot and get more costumers. To achieve this, I create an owner account and select the option to register my parking lot, here I enter the information of my parking lot and send the information. I then wait for ParkEz to verify this information and add my parking lot to the app.
4. I'm Guillermo and I'm the owner of the Tequendama parking lot. I want to know which are the most used parking spaces in my parking lot in order to upgrade my other parking spaces. To achieve this, I login using my owner profile and click on the parking lot stats, here I can filter the data between the dates I want, and click on the option to see the most used parking spaces.
5. I'm Paula, an occasional Monserrate visitor, and every time i try to go to monserrate's parking lot is full no matter how early arrive so I want to have a reserved spot for me when I get there. To achive this I'd like to have an app that let me ensure that it will be an available spot. This way, no matter where in the parking lot, I have an space.
6. I'm Paula, an occasional Monserrate visitor, and sometimes my foreign friends come to the city and we need a very long stay at a parking lot but rates are too high,  I would like the system that show me a parking spot that have special prices for long time even if it isn't a public parking lot. This way I won't pay a lot and park secure.
