### 1. List the 4 problems.
   ### * Parking:
   It's well known that Los Andes University's parking lots are limited, all potential users (specially students), have to make long lines and wait tens of minutes for being able to park inside the only parking lot that this institution has. One of the biggest problems is not knowing when a parking lot is free, if are they full or what's the approximate time in line for getting a place to park. 
   ### * gastronomic offer:
   There are a lot of different places for eating breakfast, lunch, snacks, desserts or drink some coffee around the university. But, is there a place where to find the diverse offer? The answer is sadly negative. This hinders the possibility of people to know new places, prevents the gastronomic offer diversification and obstructs the growth of establishments with potential. 
   ### * ticket problem:
   The problem of falsification and scams related to the sale of event tickets is on the rise due to factors like online platforms, anonymity, high-demand events, sophisticated scam techniques, lack of regulation, and limited awareness. 
   ### * Procrastination and waste of time :
The issue of struggling to concentrate on activities due to excessive use of social media and mobile games is a common challenge in today's digital age. This phenomenon is often referred to as "digital distraction" or "digital addiction." It can have negative impacts on productivity, mental well-being, and overall quality of life.

| Situation | What? | How? | Why? | Who? |
| --------- | ----- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| 1 | Students don't have a way to find out about new restaurants | They have a fear of missing out on new restaurants | The only way to get recomendations are by having friends tell that there is a new restaurant that you should try out. Marketing campaigns for new restaurants aren't that good. | Uniandes Students |
| 2 | Students tend to always eat at the same restaurants | They are fairly satisfied with the restaurants they frequent but they are constantly searching for new options | It's very hard to find new restaurants that are good | Uniandes students |
| 3 | Students rarely try out new restaurants without having some type of incentive to do so | Students are often unsatisfied when they try out new restaurants that haven't been previously recommended by someone the know | Trying out a new restaurant is often a 50/50 chance where you either make a new finding or feel like you just lost money | Uniandes students |
| 4 | Local owners have dwindling costumers | Restaurant owners that start out are frustrated at the low income that their buisness has | There is no real way to market a new restaurant other than giving out flyers to potential costumers and hoping that they come by | Restaurant owners |

| Situation | What? | How? | Why? | Who? |
| --------- | ----- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| 1 | The person is trying to concentrate in his work, but is distracted by apps in his phone | The apps show them notifications of new messages or content or it's just distracted by reflex action | Because these apps would give more gratification to the brain than working or studying | A particual individual |
| 2 | When trying to sleep, the person would check his phone and delay the sleep hour for a lot of time | The person engages with their phone, possibly browsing social media watching videos or posts, and getting catched by the next one | The phone's screen emits blue light that suppresses melatonin production, making it harder to fall asleep; curiosity and habit of not sleeping withouth checking the phone also contribute | A particular individual |
| 3 | When checking apps, the person often wastes a lot of than half an hour on irrelevant content | Scrolling through posts or videos that trigger immediate reactions and curiosity | The platform is designed to be addictive, encouraging endless scrolling and providing intermittent rewards, keeping users engaged | A particular individual |
| 4 | The person avoids focusing on daily tasks | Engaging in activities that provide immediate pleasure or distraction, like browsing social media or watching videos | Tasks might feel challenging and not gratifying, and distractions offer a quick escape from discomfort or boredom | A particular individual |

| Situation | What? | How? | Why? | Who? |
| --------- | ----- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| 1 | People who want to attend an event don't have a secure way of buying resale tickets when the official sale is over | They feel insecure when buying resale tickets | The possibility of getting scammed is very high | Resale ticket buyers |
| 2 | No one has clear guidelines of what a scam looks like | Identifying a scam has become very difficult as scammers change methods and adapt | Increased awareness also leads to evolving scamming strategies | Resale ticket buyers |
| 3 | There is no way to ensure the payment and reception of the ticket with this type of transaction | When you send the ticket or make the payment, there is no way to revert the transaction if one of the parties breaches the agreement | This way, buyers and sellers can ensure the safety of the money and the tickets, and the fulfillment of the transaction | Resale ticket sellers and buyers |
| 4 | Ensuring the transaction is secure can be more expensive | When you set up a middleman to monitor the transaction, the cost will go up due to their involvement | There needs to be a payment to the entity that will mediate the purchase | Resale ticket transaction middlemen |
