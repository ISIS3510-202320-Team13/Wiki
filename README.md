### 1. List the 4 problems.
   ### * Parking:
   It's well known that Los Andes University's parking lots are limited, all potential users (specially students), have to make long lines and wait tens of minutes for being able to park inside the only parking lot that this institution has. One of the biggest problems is not knowing when a parking lot is free, if are they full or what's the approximate time in line for getting a place to park. 
   ### * gastronomic offer:
   There are a lot of different places for eating breakfast, lunch, snacks, desserts or drink some coffee around the university. But, is there a place where to find the diverse offer? The answer is sadly negative. This hinders the possibility of people to know new places, prevents the gastronomic offer diversification and obstructs the growth of establishments with potential. 
   ### * ticket problem:
   The problem of falsification and scams related to the sale of event tickets is on the rise due to factors like online platforms, anonymity, high-demand events, sophisticated scam techniques, lack of regulation, and limited awareness. 
   ### * Procrastination and waste of time :
The issue of struggling to concentrate on activities due to excessive use of social media and mobile games is a common challenge in today's digital age. This phenomenon is often referred to as "digital distraction" or "digital addiction." It can have negative impacts on productivity, mental well-being, and overall quality of life.

| 1 | Students don't have a way to find out about new restaurants | They have a fear of missing out on new restaurants | The only way to get recomendations are by having friends tell that there is a new restaurant that you should try out.

| 3 | Students rarely try out new restaurants without having some type of incentive to do so | Students are often unsatisfied when they try out new restaurants that haven't been previously recommended by someone the know | Trying out a new restaurant is often a 50/50 chance where you either make a new finding or feel like you just lost money | Uniandes students |

### 6. Description of the brainstorming process and the possible solutions that came 
The brainstorming was made in a meeting between the 6 members of the group, we made a miro view of the 4 problems that were chosen. After that, all the members put their ideas about the posible features that the solution of each problem could have. Finally, we start to discuss about all the ideas and gave feedback about them.

After the discussion, we chose the parking app problem to create a prototype of the solution.
