1. How the smart features help me to generate value?, How the CAS 
features help me to generate value?. If you already answered this in a previous
deliverable, and you score all the points, then you deliver the same value 
proposition

*Answer:*

Smart Features:

* Efficiency and Convenience: ParkEZ's ability to make parking spot reservations in advance is a smart feature that enhances efficiency. Users can plan their trips with confidence, knowing they have a reserved parking spot waiting for them. This convenience can save users time and reduce the stress associated with finding parking.

* Cost-Efficiency: By allowing users to rent out their empty parking spots, ParkEZ leverages the sharing economy concept, a smart feature that can generate extra income for users. This cost-efficiency benefits both those offering parking spaces and those looking for affordable options.

* Data Analysis and Insights: ParkEZ can gather data on parking spot availability and usage, offering valuable insights. This data can help optimize parking management, improve user experiences, and potentially lead to partnerships with businesses or municipalities seeking parking solutions.

CAS (Complex Adaptive Systems) Features:

* Adaptability: ParkEZ's continuous scrolling feature in the "Parkings Offer" section is a CAS feature that adapts to users' browsing behaviors. It dynamically loads new options as users scroll, offering a flexible and adaptive interface that responds to user actions.

* Resilience: The backtracking arrow in various sections of the app enhances resilience. Users can navigate through different app screens with confidence, knowing they can easily backtrack if needed. This reduces user frustration and ensures a smoother user experience.

* Innovation: ParkEZ's use of a dynamic map to display parking lot locations and details showcases innovation. This feature provides users with a visual and interactive way to explore parking options, which can set the app apart from competitors.

* Efficiency: The real-time information on parking lot availability benefits both clients and parking lot owners. This CAS feature optimizes resource allocation and enhances efficiency, ensuring users can find parking quickly and parking lot owners can maximize their capacity.

  
In the context of ParkEZ, both smart features and CAS (Complex Adaptive Systems) features play pivotal roles in creating substantial value for users and the business. Smart features within the ParkEZ app, such as the ability to reserve parking spots in advance and rent out empty parking spaces, significantly enhance convenience, save time, and offer cost-efficiency. For users planning trips, this means stress-free parking arrangements and optimized decision-making. Meanwhile, those renting out parking spots can benefit from an additional income stream. These smart features, by providing data on parking spot availability and usage, also contribute to more efficient parking management and user experiences.

On the other hand, CAS features within ParkEZ, like the continuous scrolling option, backtracking capabilities, and real-time parking lot information, contribute to the adaptability, resilience, and efficiency of the system. The continuous scrolling feature, for instance, offers a seamless and immersive experience for users browsing parking options. The backtracking arrow ensures that users can navigate through the app confidently, enhancing their overall experience. Furthermore, the real-time parking lot information benefits both clients and parking lot owners, optimizing resource allocation and enhancing efficiency.

### Navigational Maps

### Navigational Patterns of ParkEz:
**1. Bottom Navigation Bar:**
ParkEz employs a bottom navigation bar as a prominent and user-friendly way to navigate through the primary sections of the app. This navigation bar typically consists of a set of icons or labels at the bottom of the screen, each representing a key feature or section of the app. Users can easily switch between these sections by tapping the respective icons, ensuring quick access to essential functionalities. Common icons found on the bottom navigation bar include "Home," "My Reservations," "Favorites," "Profile," "Chats â€œ, and " Settings."


**2. Continuous Scrolling:**
Continuous scrolling is a navigational pattern that will be used in the "Parkings Offer" section of the app. In this pattern, users can browse through a list of parking spots or offers by simply scrolling down the screen. As users scroll, new parking options load dynamically, allowing them to explore a wide range of choices without having to switch pages or use pagination controls. Continuous scrolling provides a seamless and immersive experience, making it easy for users to find the perfect parking spot.


**3. Backtracking arrow:**
When entering certain sections of the app, such as searching for parking spots or seeing the parking lot details, the option to backtrack to the previous section will be available in the top left corner of the screen. This is implemented with the objective of giving the user the possibility to navigate the app without worrying that they wont be able to return to a previous step.


**4. Parking lot dynamic map:**
When searching for parking lots, the users can view a map that shows the location of all the closest parking lots. When clicking on a parking lot, the user can see its details and current status.


**5. Current Parking state:**
Both clients and parking lot owners can access the real-time information of a parking lot by selecting its details. This way a user can plan ahead their reservations or simply be able to see which parking spaces are available at a certain time.
